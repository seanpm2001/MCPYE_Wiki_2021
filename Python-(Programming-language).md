# Python (Programming language)

[Go back](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MCPYE/wiki)

Python is a high level general purpose programming language created by Guido Van Rossum and first released in 1991. The current stable version of Python (As of May 27th 2020) is 3.8.3, which was released on May 13th 2020.
Python is a strictly typed language that supports duck typing. Python syntax must be EXACT on elements like tabs and spaces. If you were to have 1/4 of a tab and 3 spaces before a print line within a function, the program would immediately crash when that part is reached.

Python was inspired by the ABC programming language, and over the years has grown to be one of the 3 most popular programming languages (as of 2020) the other top 3 languages are Java and C.

# Hello world program

The Hello World program in Python is very simple and straightforward. It only involves 1 line of code.

`print("Hello world")`

Spaces between functions and parameters are not space-sensitive, so the program could also be written like this:

`print ("Hello world")`

The output of both of these programs is:

`Hello world`
